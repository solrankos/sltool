# sltool
sltool is a lightweight CLI for getting estimated time of arrival on Stockholms subways. It makes use of SL's API's for searching of subway stations and getting realtime information on a station. If you find any bugs or have ideas about improvements, it would help me a great deal if you made an issue about it.

## Install

```
$ npm install -g sltool
```

## Usage

To search for a station type ```$ sl <searchstring>".```
You will the be prompted with five options. Pelase select one of them to get ETA on that station.
There is a possibillty that the option you selected doesn't contain any arrivals.
